# Conclusion

This is the end of my short, but hopefully informative, tutorial.  I plan on adding and updating this file as I
go on.  Feel free to fork this repository and add files and practice with github.

If you are starting to get the hang of this stuff, or already know alot(more than likely more than me), please feel
free to add to these files. I know I am missing a lot of key things that go into github, but I am just creating this as
I go.  


**Side Notes:**

If you are cloning an existing project, and this project has multiple branches, you must do the following to get a
remote branch.

If you want to see a list of all of the branches, including the remote branches, use

    git branch -a

If you would like to look at things inside of the branch (not change), you can use this command to change to the branch

    git checkout origin/(branch name)

If you would like to make a copy of the remote branch to your local copy you would use

    git checkout -b (branch name) origin/(branch name)
