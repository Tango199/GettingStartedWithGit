# Conclusion

This is the end of our short, but hopefully informative, tutorial. I plan on adding and updating this file as I
go on.  Feel free to fork this repository and add files and practice with github.

If you are starting to get the hang of this stuff, or already know alot(more than likely more than me), please feel
free to add to these files. I know I am missing a lot of key things that go into github, but I am just creating this as
I go.
