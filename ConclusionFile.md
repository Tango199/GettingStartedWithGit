This is the conlusion of our short, but hopefully imformative, tutorial.  I plan on adding and updating this file as I
go on.  Feel free to fork this repository and add files and practice with github.

If you are starting to get the hang of this stuff, or already know alot(more than likely more than me), please feel
free to add to these files. I know I am missing alot of key things that go into github, but I am just creating this as 
I go.
