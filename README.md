GettingStartedWithGit
============

This repository is just going to be a repository to mess around with.  This is so that we understand how to use Github before working
 with acutal projects. 

Github is all public repostirories (unless you pay, or have a student account).  So just know that before putting projects/files
 up that you wouldnt want other tampering with.

I will be giving the tutorial on using terminal commands, but if you are a GUI person, the ideas are very close.
("Same church different pew").  This tutorial is also basically Windows based, at some point i will post about how to get git
set up for a linux based system. 

Here are a few websites that I used to gain knowledge with Github commands.

  This is also a interesting one for starters... I have only completed the first course under this, but
plan to go back when I have free time after this semester.
