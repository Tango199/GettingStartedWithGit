GettingStartedWithGit
============

This repository is just going to be a repository to mess around with.  This is so that we understand how to use github before working with acutal projects (and screwing them up lol).  

Github is all public repostirories (unless you pay, or have a student account).  So just know that before putting projects/files up that you wouldnt want other tampering with.

I will be giving the tutorial on using terminal commands, but if you are a GUI person, the ideas are very close.

Here are a few websites that i used to gain knowledge with github commands.
